## Project Description

For this project, I plan to make a social media app that has a personal assistant to help control it. The personal assistant will have voice recognition capabilities and the user will be able to post, like, delete, and ask miscellaneous questions using the personal assistant. There are multiple JavaScript and React APIs that support voice recognition and text to speech.

## API

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Fully functional social media app
	- User Authentication
	- Live feed of all posts
	- CRUD functionality
- Sarcastic Voice Assistant that can tell the weather and jokes


#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Voice assistant that can create posts, like, delete, and have a little conversation.
- Instant messaging using firebase
- Allow users to create custom dialogs with voice assistant


## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description |

| Live Feed | Renders the live feed | 
| Live Chat | Renders current chats |
| Voice Assistant Page | Displays wave form animation onclick |
| Notifications Page | Renders the trivia game, contains score as state |
| Profile page |  Renders users profile Page |
| Login Page | Renders user authentication page |


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  h
